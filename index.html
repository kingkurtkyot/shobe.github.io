          Dearest, happy birthday!

          Since the first day I knew we would celebrate each other’s birthdays together, I’ve been looking forward to
          this moment. I am so grateful to have you in my life—you are my sunshine and my best friend.

          Even though we may feel a bit stagnant in our relationship right now, I want you to know that you are the only
          one I’ll ever love. I made a promise to myself the day you accepted me into your life as your partner: to
          cherish you through the ups and downs, and to continuously work on myself so we can have a better future
          together.

          But for now, let’s enjoy the present. Let’s live in the moment and capture every memory we can today. Happiest
          birthday, my baby.

          I’m also really sorry for making you upset or angry these past few days. I’ve been struggling to find the time
          to prepare everything I wanted to give and do for your birthday. I know it might have seemed disorganized or
          even pointless at times, but I’ve been working hard behind the scenes. I told myself it would all be worth
          it—even if you were upset—because deep down, I believe you’ll understand.

          I wish you good health, abundant wealth, and a joyful, peaceful year ahead. My wish for our relationship is
          that we achieve financial freedom, gain more independence from our families, and strengthen our bond to face
          all the challenges to come.

          I love you so much, baby. I know your birthdays usually bring sadness, but I truly hope I can be the one to
          change that for you—to make you finally say, “I’m looking forward to my birthday.”

          I love you, my baby, my love, my queen, my everything.

          Hopefully… a truly happy birthday indeed. 💜💜
